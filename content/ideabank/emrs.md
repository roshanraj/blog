#### Introduction ####

Lack of fast aid causes death in most of road accident around the globe.
World Health Organization's report states average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 people across the globe every year.

Most of the death occurs in developing nations due to lack of fast aid and emergency mechanism that can help in faster access to fast aid.

#### What is it? ####

* ***Hardware*** that can be fitted in a car to collision detection mechanism that triggers airbag.
* ***Hardware (Standalone package)*** that has its own collision detection.
* ***Cellphone application*** initiate application with a gesture or double tap and press button to trigger location based distressed alert to authorities.

Incase of any road accident, system automatically sends location to Central system like 911 and hospitals, fire-station and police-station nearby.
Increasing chance of saving life by decreasing time of fast aid.
